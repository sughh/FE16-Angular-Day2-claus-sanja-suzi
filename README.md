Car Rental Project

You should in this project, have an array of objects with cars and show them on the main page.
There should be a button in the NavBar with the label "Donate 10€" and every time that you click, it should add up 10€.
When it's value reaches 200€, it should show a Message in the middle of the NavBar that you are "VIP".
There also should be a Contact us page with a form with as many inputs as you consider pertinent. Do not forget to add the validators to them!!


Challenge:

Let's function as a staff member adding cars to the Car Rental - array of objects. 

Create a form that accepts all information from the car and adds it to the array of cars. Make sure that every new object should be shown on the screen immediately after you click the submit button!!
Happy Coding :),
